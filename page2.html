        <!--A brief paragrpah explaining the history of NL Central-->
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/NL_Central_Division">baseball-reference.com</a>, NL Central was created in 1994 following a reallignment of the MLB into 6 divisions. Orignially containing the Cubs, Reds, Astros, Pirates, and Cardinals, NL Central has realligned twice (once in 1998, once in 2013) to contain the teams we see in it today. The Cardinals have been won the division the most times, with 12 divisonal championships, but the championship seat is often a very hard fought position.<p>
